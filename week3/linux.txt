Good job guys!

Now you have learnt how to get files over the internet with URL.

Practical Session : 

Goals:

- Get to use several different terminal commands

Tasks:

- Play with tab:
	- Start typing command like 's' and press tab, then type 'u' and tab,
	  then type 'd' and tab
	- Use it to see the possible files
	- go into /etc directory
	- type 'cd' and space and then press tab
- Copy and paste text using mouse in the terminal
	- Use ctrl+shift+c to copy and ctrl+shift+v to paste
	- Use highlighting to copy and middle click to paste

- Mess around with files 
	- Look at the structure in /
	- look at the binaries in /bin
	- Try to locate binaries for all the commands we learnt today in the
	  lecture
	- Make a note of the ones you didnt find
- man pages
	- man man
	- read about more commands
	- try to play with the options with safe commands like cd, ls, grep

-Copy the file you downloaded to /var
	- try copying with sudo 
	
-create a folder in your home directory
- go into the folder
- create two text files with your favorite lines in that folder
- concatenate the two files and print the output to the terminal
- concatenate and print the output to a third file
- write a small script that takes in two files, concatenates it and puts the
  content into third file and also prints the third file to terminal
- Download a text file from internet - a book in text format
- dump the contents of the book in terminal
- open it with less
- copy the downloaded book into the directory you created. 
- search for some word - both case sensitive and insensitive - in the file
- save all the lines with that word into another file
- go to /etc and read the contents of the file 'sudoers'
- check for the permissions of that file
- try reading it using sudo
- make a symbolic link to your created directory in /tmp
- cd to your symbolic link
- use pwd to know what your current directory is
- try rebooting and finding your symbolic link
